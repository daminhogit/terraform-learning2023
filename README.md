1. There are 7 blocks in terraform: resources, variables, outputs, data, provider, locals, module

2. Terraform files end with .tf or tf.json

3. When using terraform apply, use terraform apply -auto-approve to avoid "do you want to perform these actions?"

4. Same with terraform destroy (-auto-approve)
